Grocery Tracker provides a simple, fast solution to keeping track of all your groceries! 
With just a picture of your receipts, Grocery Tracker will identify your food items and list them with a countdown of their expected shelf life using Gemini's Generative AI Grounded with Google Search. 
After adding some items to the grocery list, Grocery Tracker can generate example recipes using the ingredients in your list! 
These features are implemented in a React Native App with Flask for the backend (The actual backend is in a folder named 'backend' in the GroceryTracker folder).
